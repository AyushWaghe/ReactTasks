# ReactTasks
(UPDATED)
Respected sir,
Due to some issues with my account settings on my laptop i was not able to upload the react tasks on git using the command prompt (As this was the only method since the files were large)
The codes are working fine. Hence i have uploaded the text file containing the drive link and also the code sandbox links for convinence. Hence could you please accept that. Extremly sorry for the inconvienenvce
Rest of the tasks (bootstrap,html etc) I have done using the git upload. Please excuse me just for this react tasks due to my laptop issues.
